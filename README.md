## Project Structure

This project is using Qwik with [QwikCity](https://qwik.builder.io/qwikcity/overview/). QwikCity is just a extra set of tools on top of Qwik to make it easier to build a full site, including directory-based routing, layouts, and more.

Inside your project, you'll see the following directory structure:

```
├── public/
│   └── ...
└── src/
    ├── components/
    │   └── ...
    └── routes/
        └── ...
```

- `src/routes`: Provides the directory based routing, which can include a hierarchy of `layout.tsx` layout files, and an `index.tsx` file as the page. Additionally, `index.ts` files are endpoints. Please see the [routing docs](https://qwik.builder.io/qwikcity/routing/overview/) for more info.

- `src/components`: Recommended directory for components.

- `public`: Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the public directory. Please see the [Vite public directory](https://vitejs.dev/guide/assets.html#the-public-directory) for more info.

## Add Integrations and deployment

Use the `npm run qwik add` command to add additional integrations. Some examples of integrations include: Cloudflare, Netlify or Express server, and the [Static Site Generator (SSG)](https://qwik.builder.io/qwikcity/static-site-generation/static-site-config/).

```shell
npm run qwik add # or `yarn qwik add`
```

## Development

Development mode uses [Vite's development server](https://vitejs.dev/). During development, the `dev` command will server-side render (SSR) the output.

```shell
npm start # or `yarn start`
```

> Note: during dev mode, Vite may request a significant number of `.js` files. This does not represent a Qwik production build.

## Preview

The preview command will create a production build of the client modules, a production build of `src/entry.preview.tsx`, and run a local server. The preview server is only for convenience to locally preview a production build, and it should not be used as a production server.

```shell
npm run preview # or `yarn preview`
```

## Production

The production build will generate client and server modules by running both client and server build commands. Additionally, the build command will use Typescript to run a type check on the source code.

```shell
npm run build # or `yarn build`
```


## Live Workshop Notes
Speaker: 

What's unique:
- the way that it bootstraps (i.e. the way it lazy loads, tries to avoid a single point of entry like in many other Client Frameworks such as main())
- Start at the root then enter Layouts
- Ability to quickly get up and running with Service Workers.
- Out-of-order "streaming" is in R&D
- The whole system is setup with streaming in mind
- Data is tree-shaken
- JS is not sent to the client until events occurs
- Has React bridge to use with Qwik to leverage features like lazy-hydration (islands)
- 

Q&A
Are there any gql libraries/bridges to use with Qwik?
Not specifically. A lot of work has been done to lazy load the app, and then
usage of hooks like useClientEffect() basically negate those lazy features.

What is the future looking like for resumability and hydration models?
THe next few years will contain most likely new developments in patterns that move away from patterns of the past.
